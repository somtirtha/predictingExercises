## Predicting exercise effectiveness in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset

This project is set up for us to experiment on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset. It has data from sensors like Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit. These are all fitness wear that collect data regarding the activity of the person wearing them. All this information can be harnessed to extract information regarding a person's health, behaviour and patterns in their daily activities.  

The data set which can be found at: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har contains data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They perform barbell lifts in five different ways each way classified according the level of precision.  

We are trying to train a model to learn from the different features so that we can predict if a person's form is correct or not just by analysing the data sent from the sensors on the person.

Instructions:
